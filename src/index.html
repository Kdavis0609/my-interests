    <p>One of my main interests is gaming. Growing up I have played <b>Playstation</b>, <b>Xbox</b>, <b>Nintendo 64</b>, <b>Gameboy</b>, and <b>Stadia</a></b>. My main platform for gaming at the moment is PC in which my favorite game genre is the <em><b>MMORPG.</b></em>The game in which I spend the most time is called <a href="https://oldschool.runescape.com/home" target="blank_" ><em>Old School RuneScape</a></em>. </p>

    <p>Another interest of mine is movies. I go to the <em>cinema</em> on just about a weekly basis and this has been my routine for many years. My favorite movie genre is action but I can get into just about anything except documentaries.
  Some of my favorite movies are:
    <ul class="colorli"
      <ul>
        <li>Django Unchained</li>
        <li>Avengers: Endgame</li>
        <li>Tenet</li>
        <li>Family Matters</li>
  </ul></p>
  <p class="paragraph"
    <p>I have recently developed an interest for coding. I currently don't know much about it hence why I am taking courses such as this one. I love to learn and hope to have a lucrative and productive career in programming.</p>
